				<h1>What We Believe</h1>

					<h3>Our Motivation</h3>
					<p>
					 	Although many people are eager to make a difference and have great ideas about how to do that, 
					 	few of them are actually able to find opportunities to bring to life these ideas that they truly
					  	care about. The lack of diversity in many different disciplines creates a feeling of otherness
					   	that makes it harder for people who do not fit the stereotype to get involved with the disciplines
					    they are interested in. Therefore, many individuals find themselves doing work that they don't enjoy 
					    in order to reach goals that they don't care about, and lacking the necessary knowledge and skills
					    to bring their own ideas to life. By providing a free platform for mentorship, interdisciplinary 
					    projects, and great idea sharing, we hope to help individuals from all different 
					    backgrounds find a purpose in the projects that they choose to spend their time doing.   
					</p>

					<h3>Our Vision for the Future</h3>
					<p>
						We envision a world where all people have an opportunity to make a real, meaningful impact towards
						great ideas and causes they are passionate about, regardless of their backgrounds and identities. 
						Furthermore, we believe people should be encouraged to pursue purposeful ideas that may encompass 
						multiple disciplines, because oftentimes real world projects don't fit neatly into any single 
						discipline. We see a world where all people can blaze their own trail and create their own purpose 
						in life, no matter who they are, or where they come from, only where they want to go. Ultimately, 
						we want to see each person become excited about the work they spend their lives doing and be proud 
						of what they create. To us, a life with purpose is a life worth living.
