					<h3>Our Motivation</h3>
					<p id="content">
					 	Although many people are eager to make a difference in the world and
						have great ideas on how to do that, only a few of them are actually
						able to find opportunities that bring those ideas to life. We have
						noticed that the lack of diversity in many disciplines creates a
						feeling of otherness that makes it harder for people who do not "fit
						the stereotype" to get involved in activities that they care about.
						Due to this otherness, many individuals find themselves doing work
						that they do not enjoy, and lacking the necessary knowledge and
						skills to develop their own ideas. By fomenting diversity and
						providing a free platform for mentorship, interdisciplinary projects,
						and great idea sharing, we hope to help individuals from many
						different backgrounds to find a purpose in the projects that they
						choose to work for.

					<h3>Our Vision for the Future</h3>
					<p id="content">
						We envision a world where all people have the opportunity to make a
						real, meaningful impact towards causes they are passionate about,
						and to work on innovative ideas, regardless of their backgrounds and
						identities. Real world projects oftentimes do not fit neatly in a
						single discipline, therefore, we believe that people should be
						encouraged to pursue purposeful ideas that may encompass multiple
						disciplines. In the future, we see a world where all people can blaze
						their own trail and create their own purpose in life, no matter who
						they are, or where they come from, only where they want to go.
						Ultimately, we want to see each person become excited about the work
						they spend their lives doing, and become proud of waht they create.
						We believe that a life with a purpose is a life worth living.
