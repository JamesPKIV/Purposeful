					<h3>Why Purposeful?</h3>
					<p id="content">
						We believe that discovering and pursuing your passion
						opens the doors to a fulfilling life with meaning and purpose.
						<br/>
						<br/>
						Every day, someone has a great idea that they are passionate about that
						never comes to fruition because they don’t have the skills, network, or
						resources to make it happen. What if there was a way to connect
						those great ideas to great people who can help-	mentors with diverse skills,
						or others who share a common interest and want to get involved?
						<br/>
						<br/> 
						While today's social platforms have earned their place, we’ve come to realize
						that people need a platform that brings meaning to their lives - a platform
						for people who want to create, connect, and wake up every morning knowing
						that their lives are purposeful.
						<br/>
						<br/> 
						We are working diligently to build the social platform of the future!
